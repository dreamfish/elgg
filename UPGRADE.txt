ELGG UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download the new version of Elgg from elgg.org or a mirror.

2. Overwrite your existing Elgg files. Any modifications should
   have been written within plugins, so that they are not lost
   on overwriting. If this is not the case, take care to
   maintain your modifications, although Elgg is not guaranteed
   to work correctly in this instance. 

3. Visit http://your-elgg-site-URL/upgrade.php

4. Copy htaccess_dist to .htaccess, replacing your existing version.

5. If you haven't already done so, install your crontab (UNIX ONLY)

   Cron is a UNIX command which allows programs to be run at set 
   times of the day.

   If you want to take advantage of some of the maintenance 
   functions such as log rotation or garbage collection, you must 
   install a cron tab to trigger these events.

   We have provided an example crontab as /crontab.example. Edit this 
   with a text editor to provide the details of your site, rename it
   to another filename (eg 'crontab.mine') and install it with the 
   following command:

   			crontab crontab.mine 
   			
   Substitute your filename for 'crontab.mine'.
