How works the blog post group 'ownership' works?
------------------------------------------------
It let the user specify on what of his groups wants to publish a content.
The user continues being the post owner just that the content is published in their profile
AND in the group profile.

At this moment the group owner couldn't edit or deny blog posts content but its a planed feature
to support some kind of pre-approval process to let group owners accept/deny contents for their group.
