Uncaptcha v1.5
Brett Profitt

In addition to providing protection against spam-bots, this plugin adds 
a way of immediately validating, enabling, and logging in new user accounts
without the need for email verification.

Uncaptcha uses a reverse captcha to protect against spam bots by inserting a 
"trick" form element into the registration page, but hiding it from users.
If the honey-pot form element has a value, we know a bot is posting the information
and will deny registration to that request. 

**INSTALLATION**
	* Unzip the file to the elgg/mods/ directory.
	* Go to your Elgg tools administration section, find the uncaptcha tool, and 
	  enable it.
	* Customize the settings if desired.

If you plan to use Uncaptcha as a bot-guard only, simply enable the plugin and
it will work automatically--No need to enable validation, enable user, or login
user.  In this case, leave uservalidationbyemail enabled, too.

If you plan to use Uncaptcha to validate, enable, or log in users, you must
DISABLE uservalidationbyemail.  Note that users cannot be logged in without
being validated and enabled.
